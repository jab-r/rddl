# Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support
#
# To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you
# have to place corresponding `LoadModule' lines at this location so the
# directives contained in it are actually available _before_ they are used.
# Load the info module and access server-info for a list of already built-in 
# (statically linked and thus always available) modules as well as any 
# dynamic modules in your httpd binary.
#
# More information can be found at the following URLs:
#   http://www.apache.org/docs/dso.html
#   http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/
#   http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_so.html
#
# Examples:
# LoadModule asis_module modules/mod_asis.so
# LoadModule info_module modules/mod_info.so
LoadModule negotiation_module modules/mod_negotiation.so
# LoadModule status_module modules/mod_status.so
# LoadModule php3_module modules/mod_php3-module-mysql-imap.so

# HostnameLookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP numbers
#   e.g.   www.apache.org (on) or 63.211.145.10 (off)
# The default is off because it'd be overall better for the net if people
# had to knowingly turn this feature on.  Turning this feature to on can
# slow access to your site.  Most logfile analysis programs will do 
# hostname lookups off-line (which obviously does not affect your server
# perfromance).

# If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run
# httpd as root initially and it will switch.

# ServerAdmin: Your address, where problems with the server should be

# ServerRoot: The directory the server's config, error, and log files

# ServerName allows you to set a host name which is sent back to clients for
# your server if it's different than the one the program would get (i.e. use
# "www" instead of the host's real name).
# 
# Note: You cannot just invent host names and hope they work. The name you
# define here must be a valid DNS name for your host. If you don't understand
# this, ask your network administrator.
# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
# You will have to access it by its address (e.g., http://123.45.67.89)
# anyway, and this will make redirections work in a sensible way.

ServerName www.openhealth.org
#ServerName ohcg.spinweb.net
 
# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.

# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We reccomend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.

MaxKeepAliveRequests 20
  
# KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request

KeepAliveTimeout 5

# MaxRequestsPerChild: the number of requests each child process is
#  allowed to process before the child dies.
#  The child will exit so as to avoid problems after prolonged use when
#  Apache (and maybe the libraries it uses) leak.  On most systems, this
#  isn't really needed, but a few (such as Solaris) do have notable leaks
#  in the libraries.

# AddLanguage allows you to specify the language of a document. You can

# In manual mode this directive is ignored
# Syntax: ApJServProperties [filename]
# Default: "./conf/jserv.properties"
ApJServProperties /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/jserv/jserv.properties

# Log file for this module operation relative to Apache root directory.
# Set the name of the trace/log file.  To avoid possible confusion about
# the location of this file, an absolute pathname is recommended.
#
# This log file is different than the log file that is in the
# jserv.properties file. This is the log file for the C portion of Apache
# JServ.
#
# On Unix, this file must have write permissions by the owner of the JVM
# process. In other words, if you are running Apache JServ in manual mode
# and Apache is running as user nobody, then the file must have its
# permissions set so that that user can write to it.
# Syntax: ApJServLogFile [filename]
# Default: "./logs/mod_jserv.log"
# Note: when set to "DISABLED", the log will be redirected to Apache error log

#  thru default protocol on defaul port will be requested
# Example: "ApJServMount /servlets ajpv11://localhost:8007"
#  if user requests "http://host/servlets/myServlets/TestServlet"
#  the servlet "TestServlet" in zone "myServlets" will be requested
# Example: "ApJServMount /servlets ajpv11://jserv.mydomain.com:15643/myServlets"
#  if user requests "http://host/servlets/TestServlet" the servlet
#  "TestServlet" in zone "myServlets" on host "jserv.mydomain.com" using
