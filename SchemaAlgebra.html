      Defining logical relationships between documents, schemata, URIs,

      This paper forms the foundation for a schema independent type framework. 
	  The relationship between URIs, Resources and Entities are formally defined. 
	  XML Namespaces are defined using tuples.
    </p>
	<p>We define a <em>schema</em> generically through a validity predicate. This predicate tests an instance
	with respect to a schema. This predicate serves to define the set of <em>Instances</em> of a particular schema.

    <h3 class="theorem">
      [1] valid(a,A) := a document <em>a</em> is valid with respect to a schema
      <em>A</em>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The predicate <em>valid(a,A)</em> is true for all documents
      <em>a</em>which are valid with respect to a schema <em>A</em>. Validity
      with respect to a particular schema is defined by the particular schema
      specification.
    </p>
    <h3 class="theorem">
      [2] Instances(A) := for all a valid(a,A) => a in Instances(A)
    </h3>
    <p>
      The set of all documents valid with respect to a schema <em>A</em>.

    <p>A document <i>a</i> is equivalent to another document <i>b</i> if there exists a transform <i>t</i> which produces
    <i>b</i> from <i>a</i>, and there exists a transform <i>t'</i> which produces <i>a</i> from <i>b</i>.

    <p>
      The schemata A and B are equal if the set of documents valid with respect
      to A is equal to the set of documents valid with respect to B. Note, the
      schemata may have different specifications (e.g. DTD vs. XML Schema).
      This predicate provides a way to test for equality of schema having
      different specifications (e.g. an XML Schema equal to a TREX schema)

      URI Resources and Entities
    </h2>
	<p>In this section we define a simple set of relationships between URIs, Resources and Entities. 
	A Resource is defined in RFC 2396 as the conceptual mapping of a URI. A URI may be resolved into an entity which represents the
	resource at a particular point in time. A URI is thus mapped to a set of entities which may vary over time and/or the conditions on which
	the entity has been retrieved given the URI (e.g. content negotiation). 
	</p>
    <h2 class="theorem">
      Definition: URI Resource Equivalence
    </h2>
    <h3 class="theorem">
      [10] equivalent(URI<sub>a</sub>,URI<sub>b</sub>) :=
      Entities(URI<sub>a</sub>) = Entities(URI<sub>b</sub>) and cardinality(Entities(URI<sub>a</sub>)) > 0

	<p>Two URIs are equivalent when they map to the same set of entities.</p>
    <h3 class="theorem">
      [11] equivalent(A,B) &lt;=&gt; exists URI<sub>a</sub> such that A = resource(URI<sub>a</sub>) and 
	  exists URI<sub>b</sub> such that B =
      resource(URI<sub>b</sub>) and equivalent(URI<sub>a</sub>,URI<sub>b</sub>)
    </h3>
    <p>
      Two resources <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are equivalent if the set of
      <em>entities</em> given the URI<sub>a</sub> and URI<sub>b</sub> are equal
      where URI<sub>a</sub> identifies <em>a</em> and URI<sub>b</sub>
      identifies <em>b</em>.
    </p>
	<p>
		An issue arises given the mapping of a URI to a set of entities and a URI reference to a particular node within an entity.
		Some usages of the term <em>resource</em> do not distinguish between the entity retrieved from resolution of a URI, from the node
		obtained from resolution of the URI and a fragment identifier (together a URI reference).
	</p>
	<!--
	<p>Here we distinguish a <em>Schema</em> which is bound to a URI, 
	from a <em>Class</em> which is bound to a URI reference, and relate this distinction to the XML concept of a namespace qualified name: <em>QName</em>. We go on to formally define a namespace and its relationship to the URI reference which defines it.</p>

      Entities(URI<sub>S</sub>) &lt;= Instances(S)
    </h3>
    <p>
      The schema of a URI is defined as the schema S such that the set of

    <p>

    <p>
      A namespace qualified name (QName) is a pair consisting of a namespace
      URI reference and a localname. The URI reference corresponding to a QName
      is formed by composing the URI part of the namespace URI reference with
      the localname as a fragment identifier.

	<p class="ednote">Note: Is this correct syntax to express "the set of resource descriptions identified by the set of ids in the entity obtained from the namespace URI"?</p>
    <p>
      According to the <a href="http://www.rddl.org/">RDDL specification</a> a
      <em>namespace</em> is formally defined as a set of tuples each which
      defines a <em>resource description</em>. A resource description has an
      <em>id</em>, a <em>title</em>, a <em>nature</em>, a <em>purpose</em>, a <em>language</em> and refers to a URI which
      identifies the resource being described.

	<h2 class="theorem">Definition: Hierarchical URIs</h2>
	<h3 class="theorem">[17] hierarchical(URI) => Exists Children(URI) such that for each uri in Children(URI) => startsWithEquivalent(URI,uri)</h3>
	<p>A hierachical URI has a set of child URIs each of which starts with a URI prefix equivalent to the parent URI</p>
	<p>The next section describes the relationships between URIs, fragment identifiers, and what they identify. 
	URIs identify a <em>resources</em>. URIs are rendered at various points in time and under various situations such as content negotiation into a set of <em>entities</em>. 
	A rendered entity typically is associated with a MIME media type which defines the document format. 
	Formats are typically specified using <em>grammars</em> such as EBNF. Generally a grammar defines a parse tree or directed labelled graph in which an entity defines a set of related nodes.
	In the absense of a well defined logical structure, an entity transferred over a network as a stream of characters can be represented as a root node and a series of ordered child nodes, one for each character. 
	Generically a document is represented as a set of nodes.</p>
	<h2 class="theorem">Definition: Node Identifier (Fragment Identifier)</h2>
	<h3 class="theorem">[18] node(id,e) := for all e in Entities(URI) node(id,e) => id in Ids(e)</h3>
	<p>Every identifier id in the set of identifiers of an entity (Ids(e)) identifies a node</p>
	<h3 class="theorem">[19] rootNode(e) := node("",e)</h3>
	<h3 class="theorem">[20] AbstractNodeSet(URIref) := for all e in Entities(uriPart(URIref)) exists n = node(fragmentPart(URIref),e) => n in AbstractNodeSet(URIref)</h3>
	<p>A URI reference is defined to identify an <em>abstract node</em>. 
	The node is termed <em>abstract</em> because a URI identifies a single abstract 
	<em>resource</em> yet references a <em>set of entities</em>. 
	For each entity in this set, the fragment identifier identifies a single <em>node</em> hence the abstract node is instanciated as this set of concrete nodes.
	In a similar fashion to which a URI indicates a single resource and a set of entities, a URI reference indicates a single abstract node and set of nodes. 
	The relationships between URI, URI reference, Resource, Entity, Abstract Node and Node are represented by the following table:
	<table border="1">
		<tr><td>URI</td><td>URI reference</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Resource</td><td>Abstract Node</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Entity</td><td>Node</td></tr>
	</table>

	<h3 class="theorem">[21] node(URIref,S) &lt;=&gt; exists e in Entities(uriPart(URIref)) such that e in Instances(S) and exists n = node(fragmentPart(URIref),e) </h3>
	<p>A node may be subclassed with respect to a schema.</p>
